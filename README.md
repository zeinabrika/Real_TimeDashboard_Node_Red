Develop real-time dashboard that collects parameters from the sensor
Nowadays as more Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors become available, and user-level clickstream analytics tracking is added to mobile applications and websites, there is an increasing desire to understand and share what is happening in near real-time. As well as providing instant feedback on the activities that are monitored, allowing the user to react more quickly as events are happening rather than the next day when the reporting data is refreshed. Additionally, predictions and forecasts will be more accurate with fresh data. Here user can publish temperature and humidity readings from a DHT22 sensor via MQTT with the ESP32 to any platform that supports MQTT or any MQTT client. As an example, I will publish sensor readings to the Node-RED Dashboard and the ESP32 will be programmed using Arduino IDE.
